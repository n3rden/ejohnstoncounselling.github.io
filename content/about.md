My clients have always really valued my honesty and my no nonsense down to earth approach.  I am not about therapeutic tricks and gimmicks - I believe that long standing change happens in the safety of a strong therapeutic relationship. With that in mind I offer you my unique self and sense of humour with warmth and acceptance.

I am a wife, mum and step mum. I have had a varied career before retraining to become a therapist. I know what its like to run a business and a busy family home so where possible I will always endeavour to be as flexible as I can be. If you are unsure if i would be a good fit for you just pick up the phone and we can arrange a time to talk. It is so important to choose the right therapist; if we don't have a trusting caring relationship then we can't work at depth together and make change happen.

I work with adults, young People and couples including neurodivergent and neurotypical clients. I am part of a Group of therapists who meet monthly to discuss ADHD and Autism to ensure that we are up to date and providing the best level of care for our diverse clients. ADHD is appearing in my work more and more particularly in relation to anger management work and also couples therapy.

My work with couples is predominantly on a short term basis with the average being about 6-10 sessions. I offer a safe contained space where you can explore any issues within your relationship that you might be finding hard to talk about at home. Our work will be focused on a good outcome for both parties and so I remain non judgemental and impartial.

I have extensive experience or working with issues relating to anger, be it with an individual or part of a couple. I can teach you techniques to help manage the anger whilst facilitating a safe space for you explore the origins.

I attend Continuous Professional Development seminars to ensure my knowledge is varied and up to date. I have an interest in eating disorders; in particular if you are a parent of a child/young person who is in the grips of an eating disorder get in touch we can work together. I would welcome the opportunity to work with you and i have experience of working with families who are struggling.

You can get in touch by sending an email, giving me a call or dropping me a text. I have availability for face to face and/or remote working.
