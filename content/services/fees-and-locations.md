## Fees
![Fees](/images/fees.webp)

My fees take into account the robust training I have undertaken to become qualified so far as well as my professional experience, the cost of room hire, insurance and professional supervision and insurance on a monthly basis.

As a member of both the British Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) and The UK Association of Transactional Analysts (UKATA). I make a commitment to myself and my clients to ensure my knowledge and expertise is continually developing and up to date. This means  I undertake regular continuous professional development to ensure I work ethically and safely.

A therapeutic hour is 50 minutes

- £50 per session Individual
- £70 per session Couples

*(A limited number of Concessional sessions are available to counselling students or those who have a reduced income)*


## Location
### Face to Face or Remote

I have access to a room within the UK Counselling Network CIC, which is located at the address below.



Many of my clients have preferred to continue working together remotely either on the phone or securely on Zoom. The feedback i have received is that they prefer the flexibility it affords them.
