“When a person realises he has been deeply heard, his eyes moisten. I think in some real sense he is weeping for joy. It is as though he were saying, "Thank God, somebody heard me. Someone knows what it's like to be me.” Carl R. Rogers

I believe the work we do together is co-created and each client gets a unique experience.

I love the image of this forest path,  and it reminds me of how protected I've always felt whilst being amongst trees. I your therapy I aim to create an environment where you will also feel held and safe. I think of walking alongside you as we walk through a forest path: It's never a straight path back to health and there are twists and turns.The most important part is that we never truly know where it might lead, but therapy will always lead us somewhere. I don't believe you can be unchanged by the experience.

If you think I could be the right fit for you, then please [just call me](/contact) and we can take some time to find that out. It is so important to take the time chose the right therapist in order that we can build the collaborative relationship that will help you to achieve the long term change you are striving for.
